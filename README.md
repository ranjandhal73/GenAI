# GenAI

GenAI is a Node.js project showcasing Self-Consistency prompting for AI language models. Instead of relying on a single chain of thought, this approach generates multiple answers to the same question, then picks the most consistent one by majority voting. This method helps improve the reliability and accuracy of AI-generated solutions.

## Features

- Generates multiple reasoning paths with diversity (via temperature control)
- Extracts and compares final answers
- Selects the most consistent answer using majority voting
- Easy to customize for different selection strategies
